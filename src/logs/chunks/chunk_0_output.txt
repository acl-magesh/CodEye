 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The license agreements of most software companies try to keep users
at the mercy of those companies.  By contrast, our General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  The
General Public License applies to the Free Software Foundation's
software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it.
You can use it for your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Specifically, the General Public License is designed to make
sure that you have the freedom to give away or sell copies of free
software, that you receive source code or can get it if you want it,
that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free
programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of a such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must tell them their rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
  that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
  software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
  want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
  that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
  authors' reputations.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
  modification follow.

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any program or other work which
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be
distributed under the terms of this General Public License.  The
"Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based
on the Program" means either the Program or any work containing the
Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications.  Each
licensee is addressed as "you".

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this
General Public License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any
other recipients of the Program a copy of this General Public License
along with the Program.  You may charge a fee for the physical act of
transferring a copy.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
it, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Paragraph
1 above, provided that you also do the following:

    a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that
    you changed the files and the date of any change; and

    b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that
    in whole or in part contains the Program or any part thereof, either
    with or without modifications, to be licensed at no charge to all
    third parties under the terms of this General Public License (except
    that you may choose to grant warranty protection to some or all
    third parties, at your option).

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when
    run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use
    in the simplest and most usual way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
    that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
    warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
    conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this General
    Public License.

    d) You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a
    copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in
    exchange for a fee.

Mere aggregation of another independent work with the Program (or its
derivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring
the other work under the scope of these terms.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a portion or derivative of
it, under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
    Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,

    b) accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party free (except for a nominal charge
    for the cost of distribution) a complete machine-readable copy of the
    corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of
    Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,

    c) accompany it with the information you received as to where the
    corresponding source code may be obtained.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form alone.)

Source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
modifications to it.  For an executable file, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains; but, as a special
exception, it need not include source code for modules which are standard
libraries that accompany the operating system on which the executable
file runs, or for standard header files or definitions files that
accompany that operating system.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the
Program except as expressly provided under this General Public License.
Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer
the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights to use
the Program under this License.  However, parties who have received
copies, or rights to use copies, from you under this General Public
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties
remain in full compliance.

  5. By copying, distributing or modifying the Program (or any work based
on the Program) you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so,
and all its terms and conditions.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original
licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these
terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the
recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.

  7. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of the license which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
the license, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  8. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting thesharing and reuse of software generally.

                            NO WARRANTY

  9. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  10. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

        Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to humanity, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to
  attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
  the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
  "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) 19yy  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 1, or (at your option) any
    later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston MA  02110-1301 USA

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19xx name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the
commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show
c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your
program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
  program `Gnomovision' (a program to direct compilers to make passes
  at assemblers) written by James Hacker.

# Starman for Python

![Python CI](https://github.com/your-repo/starman-python/actions/workflows/python-ci.yml/badge.svg)

**Starman** is a high-performance preforking WSGI web server for Python. It is a port of the original [Perl Starman](https://github.com/miyagawa/Starman) server, designed to be robust, fast, and feature-rich for production environments on UNIX-like systems.

## Overview and Purpose

Starman brings the battle-tested process management model of preforking servers to the Python WSGI ecosystem. The primary goal is to provide a simple yet powerful standalone server for running Python web applications, with a focus on performance, stability, and efficient resource utilization through copy-on-write memory savings.

It is ideal for developers and system administrators who need a reliable WSGI server that can be managed with standard UNIX signals and integrated with process supervisors like `systemd`, `supervisord`, or `circus`.

## Features

-   **High Performance**: Uses the fast `httptools` library for HTTP parsing and a lean, compiled core loop.
-   **Preforking Architecture**: A master process manages a pool of worker processes, providing isolation and stability. Dead workers are automatically reaped and replaced.
-   **UNIX Signal Management**:
    -   `HUP`: Graceful worker restart (finish serving existing requests, then reload).
    -   `TTIN`/`TTOU`: Increase or decrease the number of worker processes on the fly.
    -   `QUIT`: Graceful shutdown of the entire server.
    -   `INT`/`TERM`: Immediate shutdown.
-   **Hot Deploys**: Superdaemon-aware, supporting process managers like `server_starter` for zero-downtime application upgrades.
-   **Multiple Listeners**: Can bind to multiple TCP ports and UNIX domain sockets simultaneously.
-   **Memory Efficiency**: The `--preload-app` option loads the application in the master process before forking, allowing workers to share memory pages (Copy-on-Write).
-   **WSGI Compliant**: Runs any WSGI-compliant application or framework (e.g., Flask, Django, Falcon).
-   **HTTP/1.1 Support**: Features keep-alive connections, chunked encoding for requests and responses, and request pipelining.
-   **WSGI Extensions**: Includes `wsgix.informational` for sending 1xx informational responses like 103 Early Hints.
-   **UNIX Only**: Designed specifically for and tested on UNIX-like operating systems. It does not support Windows.

## Architecture Summary

Starman operates with a single master process and multiple worker processes.

1.  **Master Process**:
    -   Binds to the specified TCP ports or UNIX sockets.
    -   (Optionally) preloads the WSGI application.
    -   Forks a configurable number of worker processes.
    -   Manages the worker pool: restarts workers that die, and handles signals to adjust the pool size or perform restarts/shutdowns.
    -   Does not handle any client connections itself.

2.  **Worker Processes**:
    -   If the app is not preloaded, each worker loads the WSGI application upon starting.
    -   All workers enter a loop, accepting new connections from the shared listener sockets.
    -   Each worker processes multiple requests on a connection if keep-alive is enabled.
    -   The `httptools` library is used for efficient parsing of incoming HTTP requests.

This model provides robustness, as a crash in one worker does not affect the master or other workers. It also allows for efficient scaling on multi-core systems.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.8 or newer
-   A UNIX-like operating system (Linux, macOS, BSD)
-   A C compiler to build the `httptools` dependency.

### Installation

You can install Starman from PyPI using pip:

```bash
pip install starman
```

To install from source, clone the repository and install it in editable mode for development:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/starman-python.git
cd starman-python
pip install -e .
```

### Install Dependencies

The required dependencies will be installed automatically with the package. For development or running tests, you can install the optional dependencies:

```bash
# For development and testing
pip install -e ".[test]"
```

Alternatively, a `requirements.txt` file is provided for development environments:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run the Application

The `starman` command-line tool is the main entry point. It requires the path to a WSGI application object, specified in the format `module:variable`.

### Example Commands

Suppose you have a Flask application in `my_app.py`:

```python
# my_app.py
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello():
    return "Hello, Starman!"

# The WSGI application object is `app`
```

**1. Run with default settings (5 workers on port 5000):**

```bash
starman my_app:app
```

**2. Run with 10 workers on port 8080:**

```bash
starman --workers 10 --port 8080 my_app:app
```

**3. Preload the app for memory savings:**

```bash
starman --preload-app --workers 10 my_app:app
```

**4. Listen on a UNIX domain socket:**

```bash
starman --listen /tmp/starman.sock my_app:app
```

**5. Listen on multiple interfaces:**

```bash
starman --listen 127.0.0.1:8080 --listen [::1]:8081 --listen /tmp/starman.sock my_app:app
```

**6. Run as a background daemon (logging to a file):**

```bash
starman --daemonize --pid /var/run/starman.pid --error-log /var/log/starman.log my_app:app
```

**7. View all available options:**

```bash
starman --help
```

## How to Run Tests

The project uses `pytest` for testing. To run the test suite:

1.  Make sure you have installed the test dependencies.
2.  Run `pytest` from the root of the project directory.

```bash
pytest
```

## Usage Examples

### WSGI Extension: `wsgix.informational`

Starman provides a callback in the WSGI `environ` named `wsgix.informational` to send 1xx responses. This is useful for things like [103 Early Hints](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/103).

The callback takes two arguments: `status_code` (int) and `headers` (list of tuples).

```python
# In your WSGI application
def my_app(environ, start_response):
    # Send an Early Hints response
    if 'wsgix.informational' in environ:
        informational_response = environ['wsgix.informational']
        informational_response(103, [
            ('Link', '</css/styles.css>; rel=preload; as=style')
        ])

    # Proceed to build and send the final response
    status = '200 OK'
    headers = [('Content-type', 'text/plain')]
    start_response(status, headers)
    return [b'Hello, World!']
```
